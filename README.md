# ASP-Graph

ASP-Graph is a diagramatic tool for logic programming within the Answer Set Programming paradigm (ASP). Its aim is to provide a diagrammatic alternative to the traditional symbolic reasoning used when creating logic programs. It is based on a diagrammatic reasoning system known as "Existential Graphs", introduced by Charles S. Peirce in the late 20th century.

Uses the [Kivy library](kivy.org) for the interface.

# ASP-Graph

ASP-Graph is a diagramatic tool for logic programming within the Answer Set Programming paradigm (ASP). Its aim is to provide a diagrammatic alternative to the traditional symbolic reasoning used when creating logic programs. It is based on a diagrammatic reasoning system known as "Existential Graphs", introduced by Charles S. Peirce in the late 20th century.

Uses the [Potsdam Answer Set Solving Collection](https://potassco.org/) as back-end. GUI made with [Kivy library](https://kivy.org).

At the moment, ASP-Graph runs only on GNU/Linux.
